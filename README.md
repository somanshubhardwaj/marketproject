# Market Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing market data, specifically comparing the performance of different NIFTY indices including NIFTY 50, NIFTY 100, NIFTY 200, NIFTY 500, and the NIFTY Total Market Index. The analysis aims to provide insights into the trends and movements of these indices over time.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python installed on your system. Additionally, the following Python libraries are required:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

The project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`) which includes the following sections:

1. **Importing Required Libraries**: This section imports the necessary Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

2. **Reading CSV Files**: This section involves reading the market data from CSV files for each NIFTY index. The data includes columns for the index name, open, high, low, and close prices.

3. **Data Analysis**: The subsequent sections of the notebook will include detailed analysis and visualization of the market data. This may involve comparing the performance of different indices, analyzing the volatility, and identifying trends.

To run the analysis, open the Jupyter Notebook in your environment and execute the cells sequentially.
